# gpg-vault v0.4.0

Easy-to-use Bash script for symmetric encryption and decryption of files or folders using GPG, with improved zip-before-encrypt functionality and robust error handling.

## What's New in v0.4.0

- Added error detection for zip compression and GPG encryption commands.
- Ensures original files/folders are deleted only after successful encryption.
- Improved user feedback on failures.
- Refined command-line option parsing and script flow.

## Features

- Symmetric encryption/decryption of files and folders using GPG and gpgtar.
- Optional zip-before-encrypt operation with `-z` flag to compress targets first.
- Handles existing zip archive name conflicts with user options.
- Safe removal of originals after successful encryption.
- Clear, user-friendly CLI interface and feedback.

## Usage

### Decrypt a file
```sh
vault.sh -o <encrypted-file-or-folder>

### Encrypt a file

### Encrypt (zip first) a file or folder

```

### Display help

```

**Examples:**
